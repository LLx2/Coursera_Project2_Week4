# INSTRUCTIONS (Skip to line 39 for code)
# The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions 
# Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter 
# pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. 
# You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
# 
# Questions
# 
# You must address the following questions and tasks in your 
# exploratory analysis. 
#
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in 
# Baltimore City, Maryland(fips == "24510") from 1999 - 2008?
# 
# Use the base plotting system, make a plotting system to make a 
# plot answering this question.
#
# Making and Submitting Plots: 
# For each plot you should:
# 
# 1) Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
# 2) Create a separate R code file (plot2.r)
#       that constructs the corresponding plot, 
#       i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. 
# 3) Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot 
#       can be fully reproduced. 
# 4) You must also include the code that creates the PNG file. 
#       Only include the code for a single plot 
# 5) Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
# 6) Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the 
#       text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.
